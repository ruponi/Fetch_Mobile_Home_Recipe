## Steps to Run the App
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Choose a simulator or connected device to run the app.
4. Press **Cmd + R** or click the **Run** button to start the app.

## Focus Areas
For this project, I focused on creating a strong structure using Clean Architecture, MVVM, and dependency injection. I chose these areas to show how to build a well-organized app rather than just focusing on UI. This setup helps make the code easier to read, test, and expand.

## Time Spent
I spent about 5 hours on this project, splitting the time between Saturday and Sunday. Most of my time was used to set up the core parts of the architecture and make sure the API works smoothly.

## Trade-offs and Decisions
I tried to use best practices, but with limited time, I had to make some trade-offs. I would like to have spent more time on refining the UI, making parts of the app more modular, and improving error messages for users. Pagination for API, Standartize UI elements, Images preloading is required for better implementation. 

## Weakest Part of the Project
The project works well for its size, but if I had more time, I would focus on better modularization and UI improvements to make it look more polished.

## External Code and Dependencies
This project uses the **Kingfisher** library to handle image downloading and caching efficiently.

To install Kingfisher:
1. Add the Kingfisher package to the project using Swift Package Manager.
   ```swift
   https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher.git
   ```

## Additional Information
I added an extra view to show source content, which helps make the app feel more complete.
